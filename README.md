# streamdeck-linux

This is just a small NodeJS application to allow basic Streamdeck functionality to work under Linux. This utilises the OBS Websocket plugin to allow control of OBS.

This is written for my personal use but may be a useful starting point for others.

## dependencies

This uses the **OBS Websocket** plugin for controlling OBS, as well as a number of Node libraries that should be installed by NPM;
